If Ryder had his way, he\'d choose a moment just like this to come out, the bigger the scene the better. For his mother\'s sake however, Ryder agrees to keep quiet, save parading around the picnic in his most audacious pair of short-shorts. Ryder\'s antics raise dubious eyebrows from his hardened cowboy relatives, but 9-year-old Molly can\'t get enough. She follows her cool California cousin everywhere. After lunch, they walk to the barn to look for a bird\'s nest in the rafters. Their strange encounter, and whatever happened while the two escaped their family\'s watchful eyes, makes Ryder the sudden target of suspicion, and places him at the center of a long buried family secret. Anchored by a breakthrough performance by Logan Miller as Ryder and rich, dramatic turns by Robin Weigert and Josh Hamilton, TAKE ME TO THE RIVER constantly forces one to question any given character\'s culpability until the film\'s finale. The film, woven together by an omnipresent sense of dread, is the masterful debut from writer/director Matt Sobel.'),

Radio stations were destroyed, instruments burned and Mali\'s musicians faced torture, even death. Overnight, Mali\'s revered musicians were forced into hiding or exile where most remain even now. But rather than lay down their instruments, the musicians are fighting back, standing up for their cultural heritage and identity. Through everything, they have used music as their weapon against the on-going violence that has left Mali ravaged. They Will Have To Kill Us First begins with musicians on the run, reveals footage of the jihadists, captures life at refugee camps, follows perilous journeys home to battle scarred cities, and witnesses our two female characters perform at the first public concert in Timbuktu since the music ban. The stories of these artists are told without gloss - they are sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes inspirational, and sometimes incredibly frustrating as we watch musicians make tough choices about their futures. The situation in Mali forms part of an alarming trend: across the globe, extremists are attacking culture, art and freedom with increasing frequency and violence. They use religion to justify rampant destruction and murder. They Will Have To Kill Us First draws audiences into the human side of Mali\'s conflict, watches events as they unfold and witnesses the impact on Mali\'s musical community. With a specially commissioned soundtrack from Mali\'s most exciting artists, a score written by the Yeah Yeah Yeah\'s Nick Zinner, They Will Have To Kill Us First leaps headfirst into a tale of courage in the face of conflict.'),

It tackles how Cuba\'s recent reforms - the owning of property, allowance of small businesses, and greater exchange between Cubans, Cuban Americans, tourists, and other foreigners - have affected the lives of these racers and their families. One racer enlists the help of a Cuban American patron in Miami to bring in parts for his modern Porsche. His main competitor is a renowned mechanic who uses ingenuity rather than resources to create a racing machine out of his father\'s 1955 Chevy Bel Air. Another racer ponders whether he will participate in the race or sell his motor - one that he recovered on the ocean floor from a ship used to smuggle Cubans off the island - in order to flee Cuba on a raft headed to Florida. Meanwhile, the race itself is in jeopardy of coming to fruition due to factors ranging from its status as an elitist sport to the arrival of the Pope in Cuba. Through the experiences of these racers and their community, HAVANA MOTOR CLUB explores how Cuba is changing today and what its future holds in light of the Obama Administration\'s recent move to normalize relations with the island nation.'),

Then, too, electric media sparked idealism in the public imagination-hailed as the beginning of an era of total communication, annihilation of distance and the end of war. But then, too, fears over the erosion of privacy, security, morality proved to be well-founded. DREAMS REWIRED traces contemporary appetites and anxieties back to the birth of the telephone, television and cinema. At the time, early electric media were as revolutionary as social media are now. The technologies were expected to serve everyone, not just the elite classes. Human relationships would become stronger, efficiency would increase and the society would be revolutionized... But these initial promises were very different from what new media eventually brought to daily life. Using excerpts from early dramatic films, slapstick comedies, political newsreels, advertisements and recordings of scientific experiments culled during years of research in film archives around the world, co-directors Manu Luksch, Martin Reinhart and Thomas Tode unearth material that is by turns hilarious, revelatory, beautiful and prescient. The archival footage, combined with poetic narration and a virtuosic score by Siegfried Friedrich forges a cross-generational connection between contemporary viewers and their idealistic forbearers of a century ago.'),

A physician, Dr. Borromeo, invented a fictitious disease to scare the SS away from the hospital where he was hiding Jews. Others disguised Jewish girls and women as nuns and hid them in convents.

But this year, Kirk Cameron is taking back Christmas with his engaging new movie KIRK CAMERON\'S SAVING CHRISTMAS. Opening in select theaters November 14, the newest movie from the star of Fireproof and Unstoppable is filled with laughter, warmth, and God-honoring cheer! KIRK CAMERON\'S SAVING CHRISTMAS will change the way your family sees and celebrates this magical time of year. In KIRK CAMERON\'S SAVING CHRISTMAS, Kirk\'s sister\'s annual Christmas party is about to be ruined by Kirk\'s brother-in-law Christian, who is chock full of no-fun Scroogery. Kirk realizes it\'s his job to grab Christian by his seasonal sweater and show him Christ where Christ has always been: smack dab at the center of all the Christmas hoopla. KIRK CAMERON\'S SAVING CHRISTMAS provides a biblical basis for our favorite time-honored traditions and celebrations, and the inspiration to stand strongly against a culture that wants to trivialize and eliminate the faith elements of this holy season. This Christmas, have your family join with Kirk Cameron\'s family and dive headfirst into all the joy, dancing, celebration, feasting, imagination, and traditions that glorify the true \"reason for the season.\" Take in the splendor; take in the majesty; take in the story.

The next time his family hears from him is through a cryptic online message from kidnappers demanding ransom. French director Alexandre Arcady delivers one of the most \"wrenching and politically astute\" films to come out of France (Screen Daily). Based on a book co-written by Ilan\'s mother, Ruth Halimi, Arcady\'s cinematic adaptation offers a searing insight into his vicious ordeal, the violent world of the gang of Barbarians, and the harrowing experience of his family waiting and hoping the Police would save their son. For 24 days the Police, insistent upon handling the case as a normal for-ransom kidnapping, fail to recognize the anti-Semitic hatred of his abductors. Many opportunities to save Ilan are missed or squandered as his family receive nearly 700 phone calls, insults, threats, photographs and sound recordings of their tortured son.(C) Menemsha'),
